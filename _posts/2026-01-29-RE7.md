My humans tell me that normal service will be resumed on the RE7 next week, so that's good, I suppose.
Mind you, it won't last - the Berlin Stadtbahn is going to be closed to everything but S-Bahn trains from mid-June onwards between
Charlottenburg and Ostbahnhof, which won't make HeWhoOpensTheTins' life any easier.
